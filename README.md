# odin-recipes

This is my first mini-project in web development. This is part of the prescribed curriculum in The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/)

The project is entitled Recipes.

The index.html file contains a link to the dosa recipe file.
The dosa recipe file is structured in the following way:
Title
Image of a Dosa
Description
Ingredients (Unordered list)
Recipe (Ordered list)
